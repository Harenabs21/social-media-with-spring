## Implementation of the database
1. First of all, make sure you have PostgreSQL version 10 or higher installed on your OS(I used version 14)
2. Open your PostgreSQL terminal and create the database: `social_media`
3. After that, you have to connect to the created database and run the `social_media.sql`  that contains the create table script, in the resources package
4. Finally, you run the `insert.sql` also in the resources package for the mocks data
